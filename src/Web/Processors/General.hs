-- ** View processors

--  These take a view function and return a view function.
--  Alternatively, take a view function and a request and return an IO
--  (Maybe Response).  This allows them to do both request
--  pre-processing and response post-processing.  They will be usually
--  be used as \'decorators\' when defining routes.

-- ** View functions

--  These are straightforward view functions which happen to work as a
--  kind of pre-handler.  They are installed using routes, usually
--  before all the others.  These usually do redirects, for example
--  addSlashRedirectView

-- ** Response processors

--  These take a response and the original request object, and return
--  a possibly modified response.  This can be useful for
--  post-processing, or adding headers etc.


-- | Returns a responseRedirect if the the request URI does not end
-- with a slash.  Should be installed before all other routes.

-- TODO
-- need to include query string, and think about how to handle
-- POSTs etc
